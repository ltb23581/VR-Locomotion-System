# 🏃‍♂️ VR Locomotion & Manipulation  
**Course:** CSCI 4830 – Virtual Reality @ University of Georgia  
**Developer:** Lindsay Bui 🎓  
**Progress:** In progress - set to be complete by Nov 4, 2025.

---

## 🎯 Objective  
Build an interactive VR experience that demonstrates **multiple locomotion systems** and **intuitive object manipulation**, exploring comfort-based and experimental movement methods.

---

## 🌟 Core Requirements  

### 🚶 Locomotion Systems  
- **Teleportation + Snap Rotation** – standard comfort-oriented movement 
- **Additional Locomotion Metaphor:** _Continuous Joystick Movement_ 

### ✋ Object Interaction  
- Grab, throw, and inspect objects naturally using hand controllers 
- Realistic physics-based motion and collisions  

### 💥 Haptic Feedback  
- Vibrations on grab, throw, or surface collision for tactile immersion 

### 🎧 Sound Design  
- Ambient environment audio   
- Interaction SFX for collisions and throws
